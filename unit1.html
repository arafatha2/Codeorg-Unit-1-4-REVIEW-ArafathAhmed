    <h1>Lesson 1 </h1>
    <p> <mark>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students? -  </mark>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students? I learn best when I work by myself. This is because when I work by myself I find it to be more efficient and
      faster. Other students tend to like working with other people. They usually do this because it helps them better
      understand a topic. In my opinion, working alone can help me learn how to do things without relying on others in
      certain cases. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 2

    </h1>
    <p><mark>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options? -</mark> We did this to help make the sequence look more simpler and less complex. Having multiple types of words makes
      it look too much and too specific to the point people would not want to see it.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 3 
    </h1>
    <p> <mark>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before? -</mark>It is a system that has a numeric numbers to count and use. You can use this system to store information and
      data to create something important and beneficial for you </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
      <h1>Lesson 4</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <mark>Multiple Choice: Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change - </mark>B. The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system. </p>
    <hr>
      
    
    <p> <mark>Lesson 4 Open Answer: Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make? We would
    need 11 bits because it would double everytime. What are the similarities and differences between the binary and
    decimal systems? - </mark>The number doubles from the original number. We would need 11 bits because it would double everytime. The binary
      system contains 1 and 0's to create a certain code. The decimal system has 10 bases in order to create a certain
      function. They contain 10 numbers and have more value as it goes up to create something. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 5 

    </h1>
    <p> <mark>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when
    a car drives beyond its maximum reading? When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all
    possible fractions? Why or why not? - </mark>It stops showing the distance the cars going. The car will also start having problems. No because some fractions
      aren't able to be divided into a number thats a multiple of 2. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 7</h1>
    <p><mark> Multiple Choice 1 : Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog
    black and white image? - </mark> B. Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken. </p>
    <hr>
    <p> <mark>Multiple Choice 2: Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black
    and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true. - </mark>C. The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.
      D. The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were
      used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly. 
    <br>
    <mark> Open Response: Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x
    6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What
    sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation? - </mark>I would put it at 20x30. To sample this I would use analog data to make sure everything is sent in the proper
    form. This would impact the representation because it would show every detail in order to create the image needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 8 </h1>
    <p> <mark>Multiple Choice: Which statement about analog and digital images is true? - </mark>B. Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation. 
    <hr>
      <mark>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together
      to display a digital color image. - </mark> I would produce the image by sampling and making the digital representation. I would then use RGB pixels in
      order to add the color. The binary sequence would then help develop the image and all the contents within the
      image.

    <h1>Lesson 9 </h1>
    <p> <mark>Multiple Choice: What is the most important quality of lossless compression? - </mark>A. The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.
      <hr>
      <mark>Open Answer: An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file
      on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets
      very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider. If you could
      talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book? - </mark>I would tell him that the file shows 750 bytes because the email used Lossless Compression which caused the
      number of bytes to reduce to be able to send and not be able to get lost. 
    </p>

    <h1>Lesson 10 </h1>
    <p> <mark>Youâ€™ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text
    messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression?
    Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?
 - </mark>I would use lossless compression because everything can send and the original image would be produced. The best
      type of one to use with lossy compression is when you're going to send information on very low speed connection
      and need to send the image or text right away. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 11 </h1>
    <p> <mark>Multiple Choice: How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright? - </mark>C. It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.
    <hr>
    <mark>Open Answer Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from
    the warm-up to be okay? - </mark>We would need to add a patent to the image. I would also put a watermark in order to make sure that the image
      would be claimed as mine. 
    </p>

    <div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 12 
</h1>
    <p> <mark>Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs? - </mark>These digital catalogs would be easy to access. Many people have the internet and are bale to see these more easier and more appealing. The harms of this however is it can potentially get stolen. It can also be able to get hacked and people can ruin the digital catalog in the website. 
    <hr>
    <mark>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally? - </mark>We should care because the digital world is advancing day by day. Soon enough lots of information are going to be displayed online and not as much in real life. Having a head start and really understanding digital representations is key for the future.
