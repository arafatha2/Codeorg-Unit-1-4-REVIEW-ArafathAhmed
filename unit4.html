    <h1>Lesson 2 



    </h1>
    <p> <mark>Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work? - </mark>It tells us what the variable is used for and gives us how it is used and how it functions. Creating a variable is giving it a name and an original value. Updating it then makes it so that different events change that value and update it. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 5 

    </h1>
    <p> <mark>Mix And Match: - </mark>Boolean Expression = A expression that expresses a true or false when evaluated. Logical Operator = A symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions. && = And. || = Or. ! = Not. 
    <hr>
      <mark>Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?</mark>Yes you can by using a boolean expression. You can't really make an expression with a maybe but there are other options to create something like that by using if-else statements.
    </p>

    <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
    <h1>Lesson 6 </h1>
    <p><mark>When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below.

    What does it mean to put the most specific case first?
    Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid? - </mark> The most specific case would be to put the ones that take the most conditions in order to achieve. By doing this, you then are able to slowly make your way to the ones that take less conditions. The errors it would avoid is any form of confusion between the requirements and the conditions with the "else" statement. It also helps better organize the structure of your code. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 9
</h1>
    <p> <mark>In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code? - </mark>Creating functions helps minimize the amount of code you have. Having this would then put a shortcut tool such as "updateScreen" where if you call it, then the code that you originally would need to repeat over and over is called at one line instead. </p>
