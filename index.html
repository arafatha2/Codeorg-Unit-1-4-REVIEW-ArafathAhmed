   <b> Unit 1</b> 
      <hr>
      <p>Unit 1 talked about multiple different subjects. One of the subjects we learned about is information about a website. A website is pages of information on a site. These pages are called web pages and each of them have website content which consists of texts and images of a certain topic. The website is built in a structure which tells us how it would be organized. One of the most, if not the most important part about a website is to not copyright. Copyright is when you take the image or information off of someone else's patent license and claim it as your own. This can lead to multiple casualties such as getting sued. Lastly, many of the websites contain things such as headings and lists. Headings give a title or summary of a document of a section and a list gives a group of related information to the heading.

       <b> Unit 2</b> 
       <hr>
          <p>Unit 2 had lots of information about computer services and how computers work. A main event that we learned was how information is stored on computers.  The way it starts is the information goes through a path of digital devices. These get transported through bandwidth which is the value of information being sent. Every computer follows a protocol on the internet that transports internet and wifi to the other devices. All these devices have their own IP address which has their own specific numbers. A way to connect all these devices is through a router and to communicate with other devices, the routers do redundancy. Information that is sent to multiple different computers and devices are through packets. These packets are sent through the datastream. The datastream then puts it through the packet metadata in order to resemble the original message. Finally, we learned 2 different protocols being “Transmission Control Protocol” where packets are sent and does “error-checking” to see if everything has been received in the proper order. The other protocol is “User Datagram Protocol” where packets are sent quickly with minimal error-checking and no resending of dropped packets. Finally, the last thing we learned about was the digital divide. The digital divide is a global shortage of internet access.

    <b> Unit 3</b> 
       <hr>
          <p>In unit 3 we were introduced to user interfaces (UI). These are the outputs that the person can see through the screen. The way you create an output is you need to have an input that helps display the output on the screen. We also learned how to create events within an app and develop them based on their programming. A type of programming we learned was sequential programming. This program is when inputted events happen in a sequential order from the top of the code to the last. This doesn’t require any type of action from the user whatsoever. The other type of programming is Event Driven Programming. This happens when the user does a certain action in order for something to happen on screen and display it. An example of this is clicking a button that switches the screen. We also learned how to use comments in order to create documentations of certain codes. We learned how to use program statements which prints into the console phrases that you want to enter. Lastly, we learned how multiple different coders and other specialists use pair programming in order to collaboratively create certain things.
