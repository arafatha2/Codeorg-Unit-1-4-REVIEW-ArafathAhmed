    <h1>Lesson 2
    </h1>
    
    <p> <mark>Why is it important for element IDs to have meaningful names? - </mark>Having meaningful names can be easier to identify. For example having an ID similar to the action will help you remember it easier and will be easier to identify during debugging or coding in general. </p>

    <h1>Lesson 4



    </h1>
    <p><mark>What is the difference between a programming language and natural (every-day) language?-</mark>Programming language is very different since it uses more numbers and short terms. For example to call certain actions such as a paragraph you would type p with brackets instead of paragraph. The language also is taken in as numbers instead of letters. </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
    <h1>Lesson 5 

</h1>
    <p> <mark>What is the difference between a sequential program and an event-driven program? - </mark>A sequential program is an event that happens on sequence of the code and the event driven program is an event that happens once you do an action on the screen.

    <h1>Lesson 6 




    </h1>
    <p> <mark> Reflection:What is one thing you really enjoyed about today's activity? - </mark>I really liked how we were able to find fixes in codes that looks very minimal but actually has a big impact on the code itself. I also loved how we were able to identify what was the correct process to replace that and find the solution to the issue. </p>
