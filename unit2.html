    <h1>Lesson 1 
</h1>
    <p> <mark>How do you use the Internet?

    Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life? - </mark>I use the internet everyday.

    <h1>Lesson 2 
    </h1>
    <p><mark>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D. - </mark>Through person B then to D and also from A to E to C and finally to D. We can make a network by having everyone holding each others string on the outside and on the inside have multiple people holding it too.</p>

    <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
    <h1>Lesson 3 
    </h1>
    <p><mark>Multiple Choice: Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP): - </mark>A.   Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address.
    E.   IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses.

    <mark>Multiple Choice: Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?</mark>C.   Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes. B.

    <h1>Lesson 4 



    </h1>
    <p> <mark>Open Answer:What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy? - </mark>It allows multiple paths to be created in order to get the packets to where they're supposed to get fast as possible. The issues with this would be that if the redundancy is slow, then the different paths would be very limited and would be extremely slow.
    </div>
    <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
    <h1>Lesson 5</h1>
    <mark>Multiple Choice Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet? - </mark>D.   Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.
      <hr>
      <mark>Mix And Match</mark>Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device = Internet Protocol. Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received. = Transmission Control Protocol. Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet. = Packet. The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks. = Datastream. Sends all packets without checking whether they were received or ordered properly = User Datagram Protocol.

    <div class = "waver" id = "us1">
    <h1>Lesson 6 </h1>
    <p> <mark> In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System - </mark>Domain name systems help computers identify the links to websites. An example of this is how we read the websites "code.org" while the computers read it as something like "192.0.2.1". This allows multiple web pages to be accessed as they all have their own DNS and can be accessed however they want. 
    <hr>
      <mark>Multiple Choice: Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web</mark>B.   The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP. D.   HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet
